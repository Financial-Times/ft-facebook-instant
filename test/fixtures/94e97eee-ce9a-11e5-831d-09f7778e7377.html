			<p>Save money into my pension? I’d rather blow it on a holiday. This is the typical response of a <a href="http://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Millennials">millennial</a> — marketing shorthand for a 20-something — when you ask them about financial planning. </p>
			<p>For the generation that grew up in the Noughties, the quest to obtain the comfortable retirement that their parents might still dream of is a fairytale. Graduate debt, poorer pension provision and a runaway housing market are making their financial present a struggle, let alone their financial future. </p>
			<p>If you are not a millennial — or a parent of one — then you may not be too concerned about the financial headwinds facing the young. But you should be. </p>
			<p>Investors and the financial industry should pay close attention to how millennials are ripping up the financial rule book. By prioritising short-term spending over long-term saving, they may well be storing up problems for their own future. But in the meantime, their disruptive behaviour as consumers is reshaping the economy as we know it. </p>

			<h2>All the young dudes</h2>
			<p>Entitled and loaded with unrealistic expectations, millennials’ lack of brand loyalty and demanding behaviour makes them exceptionally difficult to attract as consumers. They want loads of pay, loads of power, and loads of stuff for free. Or at least — this is what we’re told by the people who want to sell things to them. </p>
			<p>The millennials may be annoying, but they matter. They form the backbone of tomorrow’s economy. Those aged between 18 and 35 are already the largest segment of the US workforce, according to Pew Research Centre. If you can’t sell to millennials now, in 10 years it is likely your business will be in trouble. But never mind trying to sell to them — there are plenty of businesses who don’t even know who they are, or where to find them. </p>
			<p>So who are the millennials? Many of them were at university when the global financial system crashed, which has cast a pall over their employment prospects. With home ownership at an all-time low among this generation, they are a boon for buy-to-let landlords, typically flitting about and staying in one place for not more than a year. </p>

			<p>Instability is at the core of millennial psyche. Own stuff? They can’t afford to. The income of the average 22- to 30-year-old remains stubbornly 8 per cent lower than it was in 2008, says the UK’s Institute for Fiscal Studies. This income dip is hitting the young the hardest — the income of the median UK household returned to pre-recession level last year. </p>
			<p>At the same time, millennials are seeing their take-home pay further eroded by student debt and higher living costs, making savings an expensive luxury.</p>
			<p>Introduced just before the millennium, university tuition fees have now swelled to £9,000 a year. Combined with maintenance loans, debts of more than £40,000 upon graduation are all too common. The Student Loans Company takes a chunk of every month’s wages directly from your employer to service these debts, which in some cases will take decades to pay off. </p>
			<p>And as house prices soar, requiring ever steeper deposits, millennials find themselves recast as <a href="http://www.ft.com/content/9644927c-c9ce-11e5-be0b-b7ece4e953a0">Generation Rent</a>. Even if the government hits all of its housebuilding targets, the <a href="http://www.ft.com/content/9644927c-c9ce-11e5-be0b-b7ece4e953a0">demand for rental accommodation</a> is set to swell to 1.1m over the next five years. </p>
			<p>According to the Office for National Statistics, nearly a quarter of the average under 30-year-old’s monthly outgoings are on rent. This will be much higher in London, where rents have skyrocketed compared to the rest of the UK. </p>
			<p>As much as marketing departments might see millennials as free spirits who don’t want to be tied down, renting is not a choice they want to make. A Goldman Sachs survey found in 2010 that 93 per cent of 18 to 34-year-olds renting their digs dreamt of owning their own place one day — a fact not lost on politicians with the <a href="http://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Help_to_Buy">Help to Buy</a> scheme. But millennial renters are angry, too. London law firm Osborne Clarke conducted a poll of 1,000 young people aged 18 to 30 and found more than half felt their <a href="http://www.ft.com/content/ee835f86-9512-11e5-ac15-0f7f7945adba">landlords were not doing enough</a> to maintain the property they lived in. One in five tenants had actually moved out because of the “unacceptable actions” of their landlord.</p>

			<h2>Decisions, decisions </h2>
			<p>At a time when many wealth managers are wringing their hands over middle-aged savers not having put enough into their <a href="http://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Pensions_crisis">pension</a> pots, millennials are in a different category altogether. </p>
			<p>The current pensions system was designed for a different era, where professionals stayed in one job for a long time and were generously provided for. By contrast, newer defined contribution schemes and auto-enrolment are less generous, and put the onus on the saver to make up the difference. </p>
			<p>This leaves millennials looking at such a cavernous gap, it’s easy to see the appeal of giving up and going on holiday instead. </p>
			<p>Today’s 25-year-olds need to save the equivalent of £800 a month over the next 40 years to retire at 65 with an income of £30,000 a year, according to Rebecca Taylor, director at the Chartered Institute for Securities and Investments. </p>
			<p>“I don’t think people realise how much they need to save to get a decent income later on,” Ms Taylor says. </p>
			<p>At best, millennials are likely to be paying 5 per cent of their salary into a pension pot with another 10 per cent contributed by their employer. To save £800 a month, they’d need a salary of more than £60,000. </p>
			<p>For many, the thought of retirement seems so dim and distant the temptation is to opt out of the pension (losing the employer contributions in the process) and direct cash towards the more immediate problem of buying a house and reducing the monthly rent bill. </p>
			<p>Making a short-term sacrifice may be rewarded by getting on the property ladder, but Ms Taylor warns that millennials should not assume they can catch up with missed pension payments in later life.</p>
			<p>“For the generations that came before, a lot more was in their control,” says Neil Saunders, managing director of Conlumino, a consumer research agency. “They found money difficult, but they could save.” But all this insecurity and grafting has led millennials to think about their money very differently when compared to preceding generations. </p>

			<p>Research published by Facebook this year analysed the conversations that working-age US-based millennials were having with each other on the social media platform. Unsurprisingly, it found millennials’ ideas of financial success differed wildly from their parents’ ideas. </p>
			<p>Almost half of Facebook’s surveyed millennials said that the number one indicator of financial success was being debt free. One-fifth said that owning a home was the best indicator of financial success. Only around one in 10 said that being able to retire was an indicator of financial success.</p>
			<p>Millennials are keen on saving, but are wary of anything branded an “investment”. According to Facebook, 86 per cent said they were actively saving — or trying to. But the responses to another survey suggest that this is often geared towards saving for a short-term goal (such as a holiday) rather than investing for the future. </p>
			<p>More than half said they saved “simply because they want to be responsible” but millennials tend to be underinvested, and are 1.6 times more likely than older generations to have no investments at all, also according to Facebook analysis. Whereas half said they didn’t have enough money to invest, another quarter said they didn’t know how to. And more than half of the millennials Facebook surveyed said they felt they had no one to turn to for financial guidance — a clear opportunity for the increasingly digitised financial services sector.</p>

			<h2>Case study: can Emma afford to buy?</h2>
			<p>
			<strong>Emma, 27, has an income of £2,500 a month before tax. She spends £640 a month on rent and bills, £170 on travel, and makes a student loan repayment of £100 a month. Her total student debt is around £15,000. She also pays £125 a month into a pension scheme run by her employer, who pays in £250. Other significant outgoings include eating out, holidays and a gym membership. She has no savings but would like to buy a house to reduce her rent bill.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Assuming Emma is a first-time buyer, it’s really a no-brainer at the moment — the answer is the <a href="http://www.ft.com/content/3c3c0e6a-976d-11e5-95c7-d47aa298f769">Help to Buy Isa</a>, says Darius McDermott, managing director of Chelsea Financial. Interest rates are actually very good — much better than most normal cash Isas in fact — and you get a 25 per cent boost from the government. There isn’t any other investment that guarantees that.</p>
